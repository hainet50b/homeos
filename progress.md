## Task: Scaffold Cargo project with clap CLI skeleton

**Timestamp:**

2026-04-03T00:00:00Z

**Why this task:**

First task in dependency order — all other tasks depend on the CLI skeleton and project structure existing.

**What was done:**

Initialized a Cargo project with clap (derive) and dirs dependencies. Created a CLI skeleton with all subcommands defined (init, cd, package list/add/remove/install/update/uninstall). Implemented a `Context` struct with injectable base directory — accepts an optional `--base-dir` override (hidden flag), defaulting to OS data directory via `dirs::data_dir()`. Added unit tests verifying path resolution with both custom and default base directories.

**What was changed:**

- Cargo.toml (new — project manifest with clap and dirs dependencies)
- src/main.rs (new — CLI definition with all subcommands)
- src/context.rs (new — Context struct with injectable base directory and tests)

**Remarks:**

- The `--base-dir` flag is hidden from `--help` output since it's only intended for testing.
- `packages_dir()` and `config_path()` methods are defined on Context but currently unused — they'll be used by subsequent tasks.
